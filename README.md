JHActivityButton
================

UIButton Subclass with a built-in UIActivityIndicator. Based off the Ladda concept by Hakim El Hattab http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/

TODO: 
- Reverse animations (back to normal state)
- UIAppearance support for activity indicator and background color states.
- Combine animations methods to reduce code duplication

Known Issues: 

- Tons, it's early days
